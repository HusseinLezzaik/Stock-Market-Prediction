## Introduction

</p>

We built a ML model to predict France’s stock market, trained on France’s CAC40 dataset from Yahoo Finance! We implemented SVM for Portfolio Optimization for Trend Prediction, and developed LSTM-models fusing datasets to improve prediction & made a 7-day prediction.

## Objectives
1.  Firstly, a study on the various applications of Machine Learning in finance was provided. This would help to create a more general picture of how
Machine learning and finance are connected.
2.  Secondly, the work includes a study of the portfolio management problem as well as applying the SVM and neural network methods in the French stock
market.
3.  Thirdly, a study on the credit risk evaluation problem as well as ”overdraft” data. Also an application that takes into account all types of standard customer data.
